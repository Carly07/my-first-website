# My very first website

Welcome!

This is my very first three page website using html5 and css3. 

I have created this project on the Cloud9 editor and used command-line interface to initialise a Git repository to track my files, adding and committing them.

I have also used the command-line interface to push my files from the local 'Git' repository to the secure remote 'GitHub' repository where it can then be deployed to Git Pages.
